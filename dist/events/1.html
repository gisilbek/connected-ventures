The event was co-organised by Connected.Ventures and The Entrepreneurs Network, and brought together over 70 entrepreneurial ecosystem builders shaping the future of innovation in the UK.</p><p>Attendees included leaders and practitioners from across accelerators, venture builders, innovation agencies, corporate innovation teams, policymaking bodies, and university innovation offices—each playing a vital role in helping founders and startups launch, grow, and thrive.</p><p>Some insights from the keynote speakers:</p><p>Matt Smith, Vice President at Global Entrepreneurship Network, highlighted the UK's first-mover advantage in technology policy, from pioneering fintech regulation to developing tax incentives that now influence innovation frameworks globally, while emphasising the depth of specialised support spanning blockchain development to quantum computing applications.</p><p>Tim Barnes, CEO at Centre for Entrepreneurs, delivered compelling insights on evidence-based ecosystem development, revealing that the UK's 800+ support organisations represent one of the world's densest innovation infrastructures, and challenged conventional thinking about scaling tech ventures through sophisticated data analysis.</p><p>Natalia Loza spoke about the power of combining technology with human connection, and how thoughtful use of tech can enhance—not replace—the relationships and trust that fuel thriving innovation ecosystems.</p><p>We also invited guests to take part in a networking activity by answering the question: "What's one tech product or tool you wish existed to better support entrepreneurs in your ecosystem?"</p><p>Some standout responses included: "A mental health tool that can support founders through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship." – Shuang Esther Shan "Something that helps with founder burnout and enables them to have the drive to continue on for longer!" – Krithika Kumararajan</p><p>You can explore more great ideas shared during the event here: http://bit.ly/3UGlJyE</p><p>A big thank you to everyone who joined us and continues to make the Connected.Ventures community a space for sharing tech insights, best practices, and a collective commitment to innovation.</p><p>See you in August! ❤️</p></section></div></div></div></section><section class="event-gallery"><div class="event-info"><div class="event-item"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-camera h-6 w-6 text-primary"><path d="M14.5 4h-5L7 7H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h16a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2h-3l-2.5-3z"></path><circle cx="12" cy="13" r="3"></circle></svg><h2>Event Photos</h2></div></div><div class="gallery-container" id="gallery-container"></div></section></main></body></html>
