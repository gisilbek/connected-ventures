                    <section class="event-meetup">

                      <p>In June 2025, we partnered with the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) to support the UK delegation at the Global
                         Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC), which took place in Indianapolis, Indiana. This international event brought together
                          thousands of entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers and ecosystem builders from over 200 countries.</p>

                      <p>Our role included supporting recruitment and coordinating the UK delegation, which featured founders, ecosystem leaders,
                         policy advocates and innovation experts. We also supported the planning and delivery of several key sessions, with a
                          special focus on the Ministerial Room. This was a high-level space where government ministers and public officials from 
                          around the world gathered to share ideas and align on startup policy and ecosystem development.</p>

                      <p>During the event, we presented on the topic of technical enablement—highlighting how digital tools, data platforms
                         and networked infrastructure can support stronger connections among entrepreneurial ecosystems worldwide.</p>

                      <p>One of the highlights of GEC 2025 was a keynote by entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban, who spoke about innovation,
                         the future of AI and the global role of entrepreneurship in driving inclusive economic growth. The event also launched
                          GEN's Vision 2035 initiative, which aims to build a more connected and data-driven global ecosystem over the next decade.</p>

                      <p>The Global Entrepreneurship Congress is now complete. If you're interested in joining the UK delegation at a future 
                          GEC or getting involved with GEN's global programmes, feel free to get in touch.</p>
